<h1>RQA in The Stock Market</h1>

<h1 id="sec:introduction">Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-recurrence-and-rqa">What is recurrence and RQA?</h2>
<p>Recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) is an assumption-free method
for characterizing the repeating patterns and stability of a single time
series by plotting its path against itself in phase space <span
class="citation" data-cites="eckmann1987recurrence">(Eckmann, Kamphorst,
and Ruelle 1987)</span>. Wherever the system revisits (or nearly
revisits) the prior state, a point is marked on the recurrence plot. By
quantifying these recurrences, RQA extracts metrics such as percent
recurrence (%REC), determinism (%DET), longest diagonal line, and
entropy, which together reveal the degree of regularity, predictability
and complexity in the data <span class="citation"
data-cites="zbilut1992embeddings">(Zbilut and Webber 1992)</span>.
Applied to the financial dataset, where price dynamics repeatedly
fluctuate through similar regimes (crashes and bull markets), RQA can
highlight regime shifts and hidden structures in asset returns that
traditional linear methods often miss <span class="citation"
data-cites="fabretti2004recurrence">(Fabretti and Ausloos
2004)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="dataset-used">Dataset used</h2>
<p>We used the "Massive Yahoo Finance Dataset" from Kaggle <span
class="citation"
data-cites="iveeaten3223times_massive_yahoo_finance_dataset">(iveeaten3223times
2019)</span>, which contains five years of daily OHLCV data from almost
all the S&amp;P 500 stocks. A deep explanation on how the dataset is set
up with all the details is written in the introduction of this
E-Portfolio. Fianancial markets are a great example of a complex system
becasu many traders make decisions based only on their own information,
yet together they creat big patterns, that are not easy to predict by
looking just at one stock. Recurrence analysis helps see how the market
keeps coming back to similar states over time, showing both the local
trader interactions and the larger emergent trends they produce<span
class="citation" data-cites="piskun2011recurrence">(Piskun and Piskun
2011)</span>.</p>
<p>The goal of this module is to assess how the market’s tendency to
"return" to former states evolves over time, and what that tells us
about stability, volatility regimes and transitions in complex
systems.</p>
<h1 id="methods">Methods</h1>
<p>In this module, each stock’s daily closing prices were converted into
log-returns and then those returns were standardized, so that every
series had the same scale. This ensures that stocks with higher
volatility do not dominate the recurrence calculations <span
class="citation" data-cites="marwan2007recurrence">(Marwan et al.
2007)</span>.</p>
<p>Next, each recurrence plot is directly build on the 1D return series
(embedding dimension = 1, time delay t = 1), so that RQA metrics
quantify recurrences in the raw returns. For visualization, 2D time
delay plots are created and a 3D embedding to capture short-term memory
and reveal hidden structure in their path<span class="citation"
data-cites="zbilut1992embeddings">(Zbilut and Webber 1992)</span>.</p>
<p>For each stock, a single RQA was conducted over the entire five year
period and classified stocks as "low_vol" and "high_vol" based on the
standard deviation of their returns during that time and set the
recurrence threshold so that 2% of all point pairs were marked as
recurrences <span class="citation"
data-cites="marwan2007recurrence">(Marwan et al. 2007)</span>. By
setting a 2% threshold, the plots in each window had roughly the same
density of recurrence points.</p>
<p>These binary recurrence plots were used to measure how often the
series returned near past states (%REC), how many of those returns
formed continuous diagonal lines (determinism/DET), and how long those
diagonal lines ran on average (MDL). These statistics are often used to
comprehend and prove how repetitive, predictable and persistent the
return patterns are.</p>
<p>To visualize the repetitive behavior, time-delay plots (2D and 3D)
were created. 2D plots to visualize 2D charts of return against one-day
lagged value, and 3D plots to visualize return against its values one
and two days earlier. The 3D version is more interpretable to conclude
how return cluster tightly in clam markets and spread out when
volatility spikes.</p>
<p>Finally, a T-test was ran on DET and MDL of the windows with low- and
high volatility groups on realized volatility to confirm whether these
metrics changed significantly in crashed instead of calm markets.</p>
<p>All these steps were implemented in Python.</p>
<h1 id="results">Results</h1>
<p>Figure 1 and 2 presents the box plots of DET and MDL, respectively,
that were computed from table 1. The results of table 1 were computed
from the standard 2D embedding (m=2, t=1) for low and high volatility
windows. During calm periods, DET clusters around 0.75, and in turbulent
windows, like the COVID 19 crash and 2022 correction, DET falls to a
median of 0.72. An independent t-test confirms this that this reduction
is significant (P&lt;0,02). In contrast, MDL increases from a median
near 3.2 in low volatility to 3.5 in high volatility, with several
outliers. This is also significant (p&lt;0.01). These shifts indicate
that crises disrupt the predictability of return sequences while
occasionally producing long, irregular repeating segments.</p>

<p>Figure 3 and 4 repeats the comparison of figure 1 and 2, but for 3D
embedding of the same series. Here, DET 3D values are higher, around
0.94 in calm regimes and drop slightly to 0.93 in turbulent times. The
drop remains significant (p&lt;0.01). In the MDL plot, a likewise modest
increase of the median in turbulent periods, from 5.2 to 5.5
(p&lt;0,03), which illustrates richer embeddings capture deeper
recurrent structure.</p>

off-diagonal bands reveal repeating patterns: dense, parallel lines
before index 50, fragmentation and space recurrence in the crash window
of the COVID 19 crash (around 75-125) and the reemergence of the
diagonal stripes in the recovery phase(150-200).</p>

<h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>
<p>Recurrence analysis reveals that financial return series alternate
between regimes of strong memory and predictability in calm markets and
episodes of turbulent, irregular behavior during crises. The significant
drop in DET and simultaneous rise in MDL during high-volatility windows
indicates that the price paths lose their stable, recurrent patterns
when crashes occur, yet the few remaining recurrences sometimes stretch
into long segments. The 3D embedding reduces some of the noise. DET
remains high even in turbulent periods. Visually, the down-sampled
recurrence plots and the colored 3D path make these shifts visible.
Dense, parallel diagonals in calm phases come after fragmented points in
crashes, then re-form into a parallel diagonal when the markets
recover.</p>
<p>These findings fit within the framework of complex systems.
Recurrence captures the market’s ability to revisit prior states, and
shows how memeory fades and then partially returns around major shifts.
The choice of embedding parameters, window length, and recurrence
threshold all influence the sensitivity to these dynamics, highlighting
the need for careful parameter selection and sensitivity analysis.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>By appling recurrence quantification and time-delay embedding to
daily return series, this module has shown that financial markets
exhibit clear signatures of memory and predictability in calm regimes
and marked disruption during crisis. Statistics like DET and MDL provide
quantitative markers of these shifts, while recurrence plots and 3D
embeddings offer visual prove. This module demonstrates the power of RQA
as a tool for uncovering hidden structure in complex economic data. In
short, RQA reveals the financial market’s patterns of memory and
unpredictability across calm and turbulent regimes, highlighting its
power for understanding and anticipating complex system dynamics.</p>
