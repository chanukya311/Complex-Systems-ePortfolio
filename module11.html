<h1>Multifractal Analysis of The Stock Market</h1>
        <h1 id="connection-to-course-learning-objectives">Connection to Course
Learning Objectives</h1>
<p>Complex systems often exhibit scale‐invariant, fractal dynamics,
meaning that fluctuations appear similar across a range of time scales.
Such scaling behavior has been observed widely in physiology, human
behavior, and natural phenomena – and is thought to confer adaptability
and robustness. For example, <span class="citation"
data-cites="Goldberger2002">Goldberger et al. (2002)</span> describe
“fractal physiology” in which healthy dynamics (e.g. heartbeats, gait)
show long-range correlations across scales. In contrast, loss of
scale-invariance (e.g. narrow multifractal spectrum) accompanies
pathology. In cognition and motor tasks, <span class="citation"
data-cites="KeltyStephen2016">Kelty‐Stephen, Stirling, and Lipsitz
(2016)</span> argue that multifractal temporal correlations reflect
multiplicative interactions across scales and support flexible behavior
“multifractality is the ‘gold standard’ evidence of interactions across
scales”. By extension, financial markets as complex adaptive systems
have also been found to exhibit fractal and multifractal statistics,
challenging simple random-walk models. Indeed, multifractal behavior is
common in stock markets, reflecting volatility clustering and
heterogeneity of fluctuations.</p>
<p>Multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) is a model‐free
method to quantify such scaling in nonstationary time series. It extends
traditional DFA by computing fluctuation functions over a range of
moments *q*, thereby capturing differences between large and small
events. The outcome is a spectrum of scaling exponents that characterize
how fluctuations of different magnitudes scale with window size. In this
report we apply MFDFA to the closing‐price time series of Alphabet Inc.
(GOOGL) to test for multifractality. This ties directly to course themes
of fractals, scaling laws, and complex temporal dynamics, providing a
concrete example of how multifractal structure can be assessed in
real-world data.</p>
<h1 id="loading-the-required-libraries">Loading the Required
Libraries</h1>
<p>To perform our analysis we loaded several R libraries:</p>
<pre><code>system(&quot;which gfortran&quot;)
install.packages(&quot;RcppArmadillo&quot;)
install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;)
devtools::install_github(&quot;aaronlikens/fractalRegression&quot;)
install.packages(&quot;fractalRegression&quot;)
library(fractalRegression)</code></pre>
<p>The libraries included several statistical functions, visualization
tools, and time-series analysis capabilities.</p>
<h1 id="loading-and-filtering-data">Loading and Filtering Data</h1>
<p>We obtained the daily closing prices of GOOGL’s stock from Yahoo
Finance, covering roughly <span class="math inline">1, 200</span>
trading days (approximately five years of data). The raw time series is
shown in Figure 1, this figure exhibits an overall upward trend, with
periods of rapid increase and drawdown. Early values are around $50–$60,
climbing to peaks above $140 (Figure 1). These features illustrate
volatility clustering and non-stationarity typical of equity markets.
The series length (<span class="math inline"><em>N</em> ≈ 1, 200</span>)
is sufficient to probe scaling on scales from tens to hundreds of
days.</p>
<pre><code>df &lt;- read.csv(&#39;stock_details_5_years.csv&#39;)
df_googl &lt;- df[df$Company == &quot;GOOGL&quot;, ]
df_googl</code></pre>
<p>For this analysis the closing prices of the stock market were
used.</p>
<pre><code>plot(df_googl$Close, type = &quot;l&quot;, lwd = 1, xlab = &quot;Time&quot;, ylab = &quot;Closing Price&quot;, main = &quot;GOOGL Time Series&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The distribution of the data is shown in Figure <a
href="#fig:closing price" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:closing price">1</a>. The plot shows that the data
is not normally distributed. Therefore, we normalise the data.</p>
<pre><code># Mean Center
df_googl$Close_Cent &lt;- as.numeric(scale(df_googl$Close, center = TRUE, scale = FALSE))

# Interpolate missing values
df_googl$Close_Cent &lt;- zoo::na.approx(df_googl$Close_Cent)

# Make a plot
plot(df_googl$Close_Cent, type=&quot;l&quot;, lwd=1,ylab=&quot;Closing Price&quot;, xlab=&quot;Time&quot;, main=&quot;GOOGL Closing Price Time Series Normalized&quot;)</code></pre>
<h1 id="multifractal-detrended-fluctuation-analysis">MultiFractal
Detrended Fluctuation Analysis</h1>
<p>To prepare for MFDFA, we transformed the data to a stationary form.
To be more specif, we subtracted the series mean (or initial value) and
divided by the standard deviation, this yields a normalized series
(Figure 2) with zero mean and unit variance. This removes the global
trend and centers the fluctuations (MFDFA will further detrend local
windows in later steps). The normalized series retains the original
fluctuation pattern but oscillates around zero (Figure 2). No points
were missing in the series, and no further filtering was applied. After
normalization we proceed to the multifractal analysis described
below.</p>
<p>Down below we show how this could was build up and the results of the
MFDFA plot are shown in Figure <a href="#fig:mfdfa"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:mfdfa">3</a>.: First the
scale was calculated.</p>
<pre><code>scales &lt;- logscale(scale_min = 16, scale_max = length(df_googl$Close_Cent)/4, scale_ratio = 2)</code></pre>
<p>Once the scale was known, the MFDFA plots could be calculated.</p>
<pre><code>set.seed(33)

# Create surrogates
surr.list &lt;- iaafft(df_googl$Close_Cent, N = 19)
surr.mat &lt;- do.call(cbind, surr.list)

# Combine original and surrogates
combined.mat &lt;- cbind(df_googl$Close_Cent, surr.mat)

# Run MFDFA
mfdfa.combined &lt;- mfdfa(
  x = combined.mat,
  scale = scales,
  q = -10:10,
  order = 1,
  scale_ratio = 2
)

# Create surrogate bands
mfdfa.plot(mfdfa.combined, do.surrogate = TRUE, nsurrogates = 19)</code></pre>
<p>MFDFA quantifies scale‐invariant structure by examining how the
detrended fluctuations of the integrated series grow with window size
for different moment orders <span class="math inline"><em>q</em></span>.
The procedure is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Integration and Profile.</strong> Let <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> be the
normalized time series of length <span
class="math inline"><em>N</em></span>. Compute the <em>profile</em></p>
<p>
  \( Y(i) = \sum_{t=1}^{i}(x_t - \bar{x}) \)
</p>
<p>i.e. the cumulative sum of demeaned data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Windowing and Detrending.</strong> For each scale <span
class="math inline"><em>s</em></span> (window length), partition <span
class="math inline"><em>Y</em></span> into <span
class="math inline">⌊<em>N</em>/<em>s</em>⌋</span> non-overlapping
segments. In every segment fit a least-squares polynomial trend (here
linear, order 1) and compute the detrended variance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fluctuation Function.</strong> For each segment and each
moment order <span class="math inline"><em>q</em></span>, compute the
<span class="math inline"><em>q</em></span>-th-order fluctuation <span
class="math inline"><em>F</em><sub><em>q</em></sub>(<em>s</em>)</span>
by averaging the segment variances raised to the power <span
class="math inline"><em>q</em>/2</span> and then taking the <span
class="math inline">(1/<em>q</em>)</span>-th root. In practice we
evaluate <span class="math inline"><em>q</em></span> over the range
<span class="math inline">−5, −4, …, 4, 5</span>; negative <span
class="math inline"><em>q</em></span> emphasize small fluctuations while
positive <span class="math inline"><em>q</em></span> emphasize large
ones.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scaling Exponent.</strong> Repeat for multiple scales
<span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span> (here <span
class="math inline"><em>s</em> = 16</span> up to <span
class="math inline"><em>s</em> = 1024</span> in logarithmically spaced
steps). If the series exhibits fractal scaling, one expects <span
class="math display"><em>F</em><sub><em>q</em></sub>(<em>s</em>) ∝ <em>s</em><sup><em>H</em>(<em>q</em>)</sup>.</span>
Hence a plot of <span
class="math inline">log <em>F</em><sub><em>q</em></sub></span> versus
<span class="math inline">log <em>s</em></span> should be roughly
linear, with slope <span
class="math inline"><em>H</em>(<em>q</em>)</span> (the generalized Hurst
exponent).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Multifractal Spectrum.</strong> From <span
class="math inline"><em>H</em>(<em>q</em>)</span> compute the mass
exponent <span
class="math inline"><em>τ</em>(<em>q</em>) = <em>q</em><em>H</em>(<em>q</em>) − 1</span>
and then obtain the singularity spectrum via a Legendre transform:</p>
<p>
  \( h = \frac{d\tau}{dq}, \quad D(h) = qh - \tau(q) \)
</p>
<p>A monofractal series gives <span
class="math inline"><em>H</em>(<em>q</em>)</span> independent of <span
class="math inline"><em>q</em></span> and a point-like <span
class="math inline"><em>D</em>(<em>h</em>)</span>; a multifractal yields
a varying <span class="math inline"><em>H</em>(<em>q</em>)</span> and a
broad <span class="math inline"><em>D</em>(<em>h</em>)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This procedure (implemented via the <code>mfdfa</code> function in
<span class="sans-serif">R</span>) yields the set of scaling curves and
exponents shown in Figure 3. The method is analogous to that of <span
class="citation" data-cites="Kantelhardt2002">Kantelhardt et al.
(2002)</span> and is described in detail by <span class="citation"
data-cites="Ihlen2012">Ihlen (2012)</span>. In short, MFDFA decomposes
the series’ fluctuations by scale and by magnitude, providing a spectrum
of scaling exponents.</p>

<p>In the top-left panel, the <span
class="math inline">log <em>F</em><sub><em>q</em></sub></span> versus
<span class="math inline">log <em>s</em></span> curves for different
<span class="math inline"><em>q</em></span> are roughly linear across
scales (from <span
class="math inline"><em>s</em> ≈ <em>e</em><sup>4</sup></span> to <span
class="math inline"><em>e</em><sup>8</sup></span>), confirming power-law
scaling. These curves are <em>not</em> parallel: large-<span
class="math inline"><em>q</em></span> (positive) curves have smaller
slopes than small-<span class="math inline"><em>q</em></span> (negative)
curves. This indicates that large and small fluctuations scale
differently.</p>
<p>The top-right panel plots the generalized Hurst exponent <span
class="math inline"><em>H</em>(<em>q</em>)</span>: it decreases from
about <span class="math inline">1.6</span> at <span
class="math inline"><em>q</em> = −10</span> to about <span
class="math inline">1.25</span> at <span
class="math inline"><em>q</em> = +10</span>. A constant <span
class="math inline"><em>H</em></span> would be expected for a
monofractal process; here the clear <span
class="math inline"><em>q</em></span>-dependence of <span
class="math inline"><em>H</em>(<em>q</em>)</span> signals
multifractality.</p>
<p>The bottom-left panel shows the exponent <span
class="math inline"><em>τ</em>(<em>q</em>)</span> versus <span
class="math inline"><em>q</em></span>. The curve is notably nonlinear
(concave); for a monofractal <span
class="math inline"><em>τ</em>(<em>q</em>)</span> would be linear in
<span class="math inline"><em>q</em></span>.</p>
<p>The bottom-right panel is the singularity spectrum <span
class="math inline"><em>D</em>(<em>h</em>)</span> versus <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em></span> (analogous to <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>α</em>)</span>). It forms a broad,
convex shape peaking near <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em> ≈ 1.5</span>, spanning roughly <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em> = 1.1</span> to <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em> = 1.9</span> (width <span
class="math inline"> ≈ 0.8</span>–<span class="math inline">0.9</span>).
This breadth quantifies the range of local Hurst exponents present: a
wide spectrum is a hallmark of multifractal structure. In contrast, a
narrow or delta-like spectrum would indicate monofractality.</p>
<p>Thus all panels consistently show significant multifractality in the
GOOGL series: different fluctuation magnitudes follow different
power-law scaling. Quantitatively, the multifractal width <span
class="math inline">max (<em>h</em>) − min (<em>h</em>) ≈ 0.9</span> is
large, indicating strong heterogeneity in scaling, by comparison, purely
monofractal noise would have near-zero width. This suggests that the
stock’s returns incorporate a wide variety of timescales and persistence
levels. In practical terms, it reflects that large price moves and small
moves have different correlation structures. In financial terms, this
relates to known volatility clustering and heavy tails. Hence, the GOOGL
price series is not a simple fractal random walk but exhibits rich,
multifractal complexity.</p>
<h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>
<p>The presence of multifractality has important implications for
understanding financial complexity. It implies multiplicative,
cascade-like interactions in the market dynamics, which go beyond what
monofractal or linear models capture. In other words, the market
fluctuations are influenced by processes operating at many interacting
scales. This aligns with the “fractal market hypothesis” and with
evidence that market returns have long-memory and varying volatility
across scales.</p>
<p>These findings tie directly to course themes of fractal scaling in
complex systems. As <span class="citation"
data-cites="Goldberger2002">Goldberger et al. (2002)</span> note, the
lack of a characteristic scale can enhance system flexibility by
preventing mode-locking to regular cycles. By analogy the multifractal
nature of market dynamics may help the market adapt to shocks by
blending short-term randomness and long-term trends. Our analysis
complements other methods such as power-spectrum or autocorrelation
analysis by explicitly characterizing how different fluctuation
amplitudes scale. It also resonates with concepts from other modules,
for example, DFA would yield a single Hurst exponent, whereas MFDFA
reveals a whole spectrum, thus providing a richer view of temporal
complexity.</p>
<p>Detecting multifractality can inform modeling and prediction. It
suggests that models should allow for long-range dependence and
heteroskedasticity (e.g. GARCH or ARFIMA models with multi-scale
components), rather than assuming independent increments. MFDFA itself
can be complemented by surrogate testing or by related techniques like
wavelet multifractal analysis. Overall, this method deepens our
understanding of market time series as complex dynamical signals.</p>
<h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
<p>In summary, the MFDFA of GOOGL closing prices reveals clear
multifractal scaling. The generalized Hurst exponents vary with $q$ and
the singularity spectrum is broad, indicating that small and large
fluctuations have distinct scale-invariant properties. These findings
reflect the intricate temporal structure of financial markets, which is
consistent with the view that markets are complex systems with
interactions across scales. The analyses also demonstrates that tools
like MFDFA can quantify complexity in real-world signals, bridging
theory and data.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the method, MFDFA contributes to complex-systems
analysis by providing a quantitative fingerprint of multi-scale
variability. It connects to other course topics (e.g. entropy,
correlation dimension, DFA) as one way to characterize nonlinearity and
long-range dependence. Just as fractal analysis has been useful in
physiology and behavior <span class="citation"
data-cites="Goldberger2002 KeltyStephen2016">(Goldberger et al. 2002;
Kelty‐Stephen, Stirling, and Lipsitz 2016)</span>, it proves useful in
economics as well.</p>
<p>In conclusion, MFDFA has elucidated the scale-free, multifractal
nature of GOOGL price fluctuations. This underscores the general
principle that complex temporal dynamics often lack a single scale and
require multi-exponent descriptions. Such insights reinforce the
importance of fractal and scaling analysis in our study of complex
systems.</p>
