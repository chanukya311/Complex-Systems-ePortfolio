<h1>Self-Organization & Emergence in The Stock Market</h1>

        <h1 id="sec:introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>In this module, emergence and self-organization is discussed in the
context of complex systems, specifically in the context of the stock
market of the last five years.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-emergence-self-organization">What is emergence &amp;
self organization?</h2>
<p>Emergence is the concept of describing how a pattern property at
system level appears and that it cannot be directly inferred from the
behavior of individual components. Only when looked at when all local
interactions are taken together, do new structures and patterns appear
(emerge) <span class="citation" data-cites="camazine2001self">(Camazine
et al. 2001)</span>. Self-organization is the concept of those emergent
patterns form spontaneously, without any central control <span
class="citation" data-cites="camazine2001self">(Camazine et al.
2001)</span>. Individual agents follow simple, local rules, or
interactions and yet the entire system organizes itself into self-made
structures. In complex systems, emergence and self organization explain
how collective behavior arises from individual decisions and how the
system adapts to changing conditions <span class="citation"
data-cites="camazine2001self">(Camazine et al. 2001)</span></p>
<h2 id="dataset-used">Dataset used</h2>
<p>We used the "Massive Yahoo Finance Dataset" from Kaggle <span
class="citation"
data-cites="iveeaten3223times_massive_yahoo_finance_dataset">(iveeaten3223times
2019)</span>, which contains five years of daily OHLCV data from almost
all the S&amp;P 500 stocks. A deep explanation on how the dataset is set
up with all the details is written in the introduction of this
E-Portfolio. Financial markets are a classic example of a
self-organizing system. It includes local interactions, where traders
react individually to news and price movements. It also shows emergent
patterns, due to sector rotations, broad market rallies or crashes that
cannot be predicted from any single stock alone<span class="citation"
data-cites="sornette2003why">(Sornette 2003)</span>, <span
class="citation" data-cites="mantegna1999hierarchical">(Mantegna
1999)</span>.</p>
<h1 id="methods">Methods</h1>
<p>The first step was the pre-processing of the dataset. The Date column
was parsed into a proper DataTime index, pivoting to a table of close
prices for each stock by date, and computing daily returns via
percentage change. By converting to returns, it strips out any long-term
price trends and focuses on the co-movement that underlies the emergent
market structure.</p>
<p>The second step was to capture how the market structure evolves. A
rolling-window network approach was used to capture this. The window was
set at 60 trading days, advancing by 5 days each time, and in each
window the Pearson’s correlation matrix of returns was calculated.</p>
<p>After the 60 day windows were computed, a graph was built by placing
an threshold between two stocks whenever their correlation exceeded 0,7.
This threshold was set to ensure the focus on the strongest pairwise
interaction that drive true emergent clusters <span class="citation"
data-cites="onnela2003dynamics">(Onnela et al. 2003)</span>, while the
rolling window reflects the market’s dynamics, allowing the clusters to
form, dissolve and re-form as conditions change.</p>
<p>On each thresholded network, a greedy modularity algorithm was run to
detect communities in the stock market <span class="citation"
data-cites="blondel2008fast">(Blondel et al. 2008)</span>. For every
window the following three parameters were recorded: the sizes of the
top three communities, the global modularity score, and the average
clustering coefficient. Tracking both modularity and clustering allowed
to distinguish when the market organizes into few well defined camps
versus when tight local communities dominate.</p>
<p>Finally, the dynamics were visualized into two ways: a time-series
plots of community sizes, modularity and clustering coefficient to
pinpoint when emergent structures strengthen or collapse and an alluvial
(Sankey) diagram for key market regimes, like the COVID crash, to show
how individual stocks migrate between communities across windows. These
visualizations make the processes of emergence and self-organization
visible and traceable in the data.</p>
<h1 id="results">Results</h1>
<p>After doing the analysis: how the market evolves, 60-day window and
the modularity and clustering coefficient, several plots were
constructed to visualize the (possible) emergent and self organization
behavior of the stock data.</p>
<p>Figure 1 presents the daily closing prizes of AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN
and NVDA over a five year period. In 2019 and early 2020, the five
stocks had a steady bull run, in February/march 2020, this bull run
plummeted with 30 to 40 % in weeks, due to the COVID crash. In November
2021 a new bull market emerged, especially by NVDA and AMZN. There was a
correction in early 2022 and a gradual recovery in late 2023. These
price regimes form the backdrop for the network reconfigurations that
are analyzed below.</p>

<figcaption>Figure 1: Plot of AAPL MSFT GOOGL AMZN NVDA over 5-year
window</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In figure 2, the top three community sizes of the 60-day window are
illustrated. In early 2019, the dominant community contained between
80-120 stocks, the second community about 50-70 and the smallest
community about 24-40 stocks. Early 2019 reflects a sectorization in a
calm market. When the COVID crash begon, the largest community grew to
approximately 250 stocks, which demonstrates that extreme stress drives
a broad synchronization among stocks. The weeks following the crash, the
largest community plummeted back to 60-80 stocks, while the second and
third community grew to 80-120 stocks. During the bull market in 2020
and 2021, the dominant community built over 200 stocks.</p>

</figure>
<p>To visualize how individual stocks migrate between emergent
communities, the alluvial plot is demonstrated. Figure 3 to 7 present
these alluvial plots for four key regimes. Figure 4
(recovery 22-23), the ribbons show again straight flowing communities,
marking the stabilization of emergent communities in the recovery phase
of the COVID crash. Figure 5 (Bull Market) shows nearly straight parallel ribbons across the
windows, which reflect a stable, calm regime. In figure 6 ( 2022
correction), new clusters take shape in mid 2022. Finally, figure 7 (COVID crash) shows the ribbons from all prior communities converge into a single block by
early March 2020, they later divide into multiple communities. This
shows the autonomous collapse and reconstruction of the network.</p>

</figure>
<p>In figure 8, the modularity (blue) and clustering coefficient
(orange) over time is displayed over the same windows of 60 days. There
are periods of high modularity, around 0.75-0.85 in mid 2020 and again
in late 2022-2023, together with a low clustering coefficient,
indicating the spontaneous emergence of a few separated communities. On
contrast, during periods of extreme stress like the COVID crash and the
2022 correction, the clustering coefficient spikes to 0.6-0.8 while the
modularity plummets down to 0.2-0.3. This means that in that context,
almost every pair of neighboring stocks forms a triangle, there is no
clear global partition.</p>
<p>In self-organizing systems like financial markets, large, well
defined clusters and tight local connections are mutually exclusive. As
clear global communities emerge, small cohesive groups weaken, and as
local cohesion grows stronger, global structure weakens.</p>

<h1 id="discussion-conclusion">Discussion &amp; Conclusion</h1>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>This analysis demonstrates how financial markets exhibit both
emergence and self-organization through the dynamic play between various
tickers of various communities. During periods of volatility, like the
COVID-19 crash and the 2022 correction, the average clustering
coefficient is high, as nearly every stock forms tight, overlapping
"triangles" of high correlation. Simultaneously, modularity is low
because the market behaves as one block rather than a collection of
distinct sectors. On the other hand, in calmer markets, the network
self-organizes into a few well-separated communities: clear sector-like
clusters emerge and modularity is high.</p>
<p>The contrast of high modularity and a low clustering coefficient in
calm markets and vice versa illustrates a hallmark of complex systems:
without any central coordinator, local interactions alone produce
coherent macro patterns. However, this method also reveals important
limitations. The choice of a fixed 60-day window and a 0.7 correlation
threshold strongly shapes the size and stability of detected
communities. Pearson correlation ignores nonlinear dependencies, and
greedy modularity can miss small, but meaningful sub clusters. This is
because the modularity function has a built-it "resolution limit": it
tends to merge small groups into larger ones when the overall network is
large, making fine-grained structures invisible <span class="citation"
data-cites="fortunato2007resolution">(Fortunato and Barthélemy
2007)</span>.</p>
<p>In future research, other nonlinear methods can be used to
demonstrate the emergence and self-organizational characteristics of the
network that add to the proven linear emergence and self-organization in
this E-portfolio module.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this E-portfolio module, the rolling window correlation networks,
community detection and complementary network metrics were used on the
Yahoo finance dataset. Large, well-defined markets sectors emerge
spontaneously when volatility is low, and these sectors autonomously
fragment into tightly connected local pockets under stress. The alluvial
plots (figure ... till ...) made the migration of individual stocks
between clusters explicit, illustrating the self-organizing aspect of
the market structure in response to crashes. Together, these findings
provide a clear, illustration of emergence and self-organization, while
also highlighting the importance of more nuanced, adaptive network
approaches.</p>
