<h1>Uncovering Complex Dynamics</h1>

<h1 id="connection-to-course-learning-objectives">Connection to Course
Learning Objectives</h1>
<p>Financial markets behave as complex systems with nonlinear
interactions and feedback loops. Traditional models often assume simple
or random behavior, however real market dynamics can be more intricate.
In these series of modules we will mainly analyze the GOOGL’s daily
stock price using concepts from nonlinear dynamics, such as state space
and attractors in this module, in order to explore whether the data
reveals any underlying dynamic pattern.</p>
<p>We treat GOOGL’s stock price time series as an observable of an
underlying complex system (the company and its investors). These
aggregate variables can serve as an order parameter that captures the
system’s state. Here the stock price is assumed to reflect the
collective behavior of investors and the company’s performance, making
it a proxy for the system’s state. This approach allows us to explore
whether the stock exhibits signs of nonlinear dynamic structure (such as
a tendency toward an equilibrium or a recurring cycle) or if it behaves
more like a purely stochastic process.</p>
<p>Our analysis involves reconstructing the system’s phase space from
the single variable time series and looking for indications of
attractors. A state space is the mathematical space of all possible
states of a system <span class="citation"
data-cites="Abraham1992">(Abraham and Shaw 1992)</span>. BY plotting the
evolution of the stock in this space we obtain a visual phase portrait
of its dynamics. More specifically, we plot the stock price against its
recent change (daily return), which serves as a two-dimensional
representation of the system’s state at each moment. If the stock’s
dynamics have a low-dimensional deterministic structure, the trajectory
in state space may converge to a geometric shape such as a point or a
cycle, i.e. an attractor that characterizes long-term behavior. On the
other hand, if movements are dominated by high-dimensional factors or
noise, the phase portrait may appear diffuse and not settle into any
simple pattern <span class="citation"
data-cites="Abraham1992 Butner2015">(Abraham and Shaw 1992; Butner et
al. 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>We initially considered computing Lyapunov exponents (quantitative
measures of chaos) for this time series, but we decided to focus on
qualitative geometric analysis instead. Lyapunov exponent estimation
would have required long, stationary data and is beyond our scope.
Instead we used visual tools to identify any qualitative signatures of
nonlinearity or stability in the stock’s behavior.</p>

<p>State Space Reconstruction: To analyze the dynamics, we reconstructed
a two-dimensional state space from the one-dimensional time series. One
axis of the state space is the stock price <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em>(<em>t</em>)</span> itself, and the other
axis is the discrete time derivative (daily change) <span
class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>x</em>(<em>t</em>) = <em>x</em>(<em>t</em> + 1) − <em>x</em>(<em>t</em>)</span>.
Thus, each day is represented by a point <span
class="math inline">(<em>x</em>(<em>t</em>), <em>Δ</em><em>x</em>(<em>t</em>))</span>,
capturing the state (price) and its velocity (overnight change).
Plotting all such points and connecting successive ones yields a
trajectory that shows how the system moves from one state to the next
over time. This construction is analogous to phase-space analysis in
physics <span class="citation" data-cites="Abraham1992">(Abraham and
Shaw 1992)</span>. By using price change as the second dimension, we
treat the stock price like a dynamical variable with momentum, which can
help reveal tendencies such as stability or cycles in the price
evolution.</p>
<p>Vector Field and Density Plot: We plotted arrows between successive
state points to visualize state transitions and overlaid a 2D density
contour to highlight frequently visited regions <span class="citation"
data-cites="Butner2015">(Butner et al. 2015)</span>. The resulting
vector density plot serves as our phase portrait.</p>
<p>All analysis and plotting were done in R. The key steps are
documented in the code blocks below.</p>
<h1 id="loading-the-required-libraries">Loading the Required
Libraries</h1>
<p>To perform our analysis we loaded several R libraries:</p>
<pre><code>library(Hmisc)
library(grid)
library(ggplot2)
library(moments)
library(e1071)
library(rgl)
library(nonlinearTseries)
library(lubridate)</code></pre>
<p>The libraries included several statistical functions, visualization
tools, and time-series analysis capabilities.</p>
<h1 id="loading-and-filtering-data">Loading and Filtering Data</h1>
<p>We begin by loading the dataset and isolating GOOGL stock:</p>
<pre><code>df &lt;- read.csv(&#39;stock_details_5_years.csv&#39;)
df_googl &lt;- df[df$Company == &quot;GOOGL&quot;, ]
df_googl</code></pre>
<p>This results in a dataset containing the daily stock price details
for GOOGL. We have chosen to only use GOOGL for this analysis since it
has been one of the biggest companies for a significant amount of time,
and this made it a suitable candidate for studying stock market
dynamics. The extensive trading volume and historical data availability
allow for an extensive statistical analysis, which makes it easier to
detect trends, volatility shifts, and potential nonlinear behaviours in
the stock price movements. Furthermore, GOOGL’s presence across various
economic cycles provides a comprehensive dataset for exploring both
short-term fluctuations and long-term structural changes in the
market.</p>
<h1 id="visualizing-opening-prices-over-time">Visualizing Opening Prices
Over Time</h1>
<p>Time-series data, such as stock prices, often exhibit trends, cycles,
and volatility <span class="citation" data-cites="box1976">(Box and
Jenkins 1976)</span>. To gain an initial understanding, we plot the time
series of opening prices. This allows us to observe potential trends
over time and identify any recurring cycles. This may provide valuable
insights into the underlying dynamics of GOOGL’s stock as can be seen in

<p>This figure shows the daily opening prices of GOOGL over the analyzed
period. The stock exhibits an overall upward trend (reflecting the
company’s growth) punctuated by episodes of volatility and occasional
sharp drops. The price clearly does not stay at any fixed level, but
moves through different regimes in response to market conditions.</p>

<p>Understanding the distribution of price changes is crucial in
financial modelling. The normality of returns is a key assumption in
classical financial theory <span class="citation"

find deviations, such as skewness and heavy tails <span class="citation"
data-cites="cont2001">(Cont 2001)</span>. We analyse the density of
price differences. The density plot is shown in Figure <a

</figure>
<p>The reconstructed phase portrait of GOOGL is presented in Figure <a
href="#fig:vector density" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:vector density">4</a>, the vector density plot. In
this figure, the horizontal axis is the stock price <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em>(<em>t</em>)</span> and the vertical axis
is the one-day price change <span
class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>x</em>(<em>t</em>)</span>. Each point
represents the state of the system on a given day, and arrows indicate
the transition to the next day’s state. Darker regions (higher point
density) highlight where the system’s state occurs most frequently.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:vector density" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:vector density">4</a> reveals that the majority of
points lie near the horizontal line <span
class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>x</em> = 0</span>, especially in the
mid-range of prices. In other words, small day-to-day changes (both up
and down) are the most common behavior for this stock. The high density
of states along <span
class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>x</em> ≈ 0</span> indicates that the
price often experiences little net change from one day to the next,
reflecting short-term stability or inertia in the absence of major
disturbances.</p>
<p>Notably, we do not observe a single narrow cluster or closed-loop
trajectory that would indicate a clear attractor such as a fixed point
or limit cycle. Instead, the points and vectors are spread over a broad
region of the state space. There is no convergence of the trajectory to
any particular price level that would serve as an equilibrium attractor;
the stock does not gravitate toward a constant long-term value.
Likewise, there is no repeating cyclical pattern visible, a limit cycle
would appear as a loop in the plot, and none is present. The trajectory
covers a wide range of prices rather than orbiting within a bounded
cycle. This suggests that GOOGL’s price dynamics do not have a
low-dimensional deterministic attractor governing them.</p>
<p>We do see some state-dependent patterns, for instance, when the price
reaches an extreme high or low relative to its recent history, the
subsequent change tends to be larger and often opposite in direction
(e.g., very high prices are sometimes followed by negative returns, and
vice versa). This hint of mean-reversion at the extremes implies a
nonlinear tendency for the stock to correct when it moves far from its
prior range. However, these corrections are not sufficient to create a
confined basin of attraction; they simply show that the system slows
down or reverses when reaching unusual states. Overall, the phase space
portrait appears diffuse and lacks a focal structure, which is
consistent with the idea that the stock’s movements are influenced by
many external factors (news, market trends, etc.) and considerable
randomness. In short, the visual analysis points to high-dimensional or
stochastic dynamics rather than a simple repeating pattern.</p>
<h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>
<p>The absence of a simple attractor in GOOGL’s phase space suggests
that its price dynamics are largely driven by a combination of factors
and noise, rather than by a low-dimensional deterministic system,
consistent with the view of financial markets as complex adaptive
systems in which there is no fixed equilibrium or cycle. This finding
aligns with theoretical expectations for one-dimensional dynamics. A
single-variable system cannot exhibit sustained oscillations or chaos
without additional degrees of freedom <span class="citation"
data-cites="Abraham1992">(Abraham and Shaw 1992)</span>. In GOOGL’s
case, a fixed-point attractor (constant price) or a limit cycle (regular
oscillation) do not exist, as expected in a one-variable system. Any
deterministic attractor in the stock’s behavior is likely
high-dimensional and thus would not be visible in our 2D analysis <span
class="citation" data-cites="Butner2015">(Butner et al.
2015)</span>.</p>
<p>Even without a clear attractor, the phase portrait visualization
proved insightful. Following the approach of <span class="citation"
data-cites="Butner2015">Butner et al. (2015)</span>, we used this
topological representation to identify qualitative features of the
stock’s behavior. We observed that the price tends to stabilize (very
small <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>x</em></span>) during
normal periods and that extreme deviations are often followed by
corrective moves. This state-dependent behavior <span class="citation"
data-cites="AttractorSlides2024">(Wiltshire, Travis J. 2024)</span> is a
nonlinear feature that linear models would not capture. It suggests that
the system’s response depends on its current state: within normal price
ranges, changes remain small, but at extreme prices, stronger forces
push the price back toward the middle. This observation resonates with
the attractor dynamics notion that sufficiently strong perturbations can
induce a regime shift <span class="citation"
data-cites="AttractorSlides2024">(Wiltshire, Travis J. 2024)</span> — in
stock market terms, news can push the price into a new regime or
trend.</p>
<p>Although we did not compute a Lyapunov exponent, the qualitative
evidence suggests GOOGL’s price is better characterized as a complex
stochastic system rather than a low-dimensional chaotic one. The diffuse
phase portrait and the price’s sensitivity to external events indicate
that while some structure exists (e.g. the mild mean-reverting
tendencies noted), it is of higher complexity than a simple
deterministic attractor.</p>
<p>In summary, applying nonlinear dynamics tools to GOOGL shows the
value of a qualitative complex-systems perspective on financial data. We
gained intuition about stability (short-term price inertia) and
instability (sudden shifts) in the stock’s trajectory that complements
traditional statistical analyses. These insights emphasize the
qualitative dynamics of the data and underscore that even if markets do
not have easily identifiable low-dimensional attractors, they still
exhibit structured, state-dependent behavior characteristic of complex
adaptive systems.</p>
<h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
<p>This analysis of GOOGL’s stock illustrates on a micro level the same
complexity principles that appear on a macro level in financial markets.
In the broader context of this portfolio, it complements other
components by showing that even an individual asset’s time series
exhibits nonlinear patterns and state-dependent behaviors. For instance,
while other modules might examine networks of stocks or market indices,
here we focused on a single stock’s dynamics and still found signs of
complex behavior. Together, these perspectives reinforce the notion that
markets are highly dynamic across scales.</p>
<p>By applying concepts like state space and attractors to real market
data, this case study shows the value of qualitative dynamical analysis
in finance. We gained intuition about stability (short-term equilibrium
tendencies) and instability (sudden regime shifts) that aligns with
broader market phenomena such as trends and corrections. Overall, this
case study reinforces the course theme that financial markets can be
analyzed as complex systems using nonlinear dynamics concepts.</p>
